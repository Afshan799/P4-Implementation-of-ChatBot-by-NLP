# **Implementation of Chatbot using NLP**

The creation and deployment of a chatbot utilising **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques is demonstrated in this project. By simulating human-like dialogue, the chatbot provides a smooth engagement experience. This repository shows how natural language processing (NLP) may be used to create intelligent conversational agents by providing a thorough tutorial on how to create a simple chatbot in Python.

## **Features**

- **Intent Recognition:** Uses NLP techniques and predefined patterns to identify user intents.
**Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Extracts relevant context from user input.
**Rule-Based Responses:** Produces pertinent responses by using a set of predetermined rules.
The design is extensible, allowing for the addition of new intents and answers for improved usefulness.
With an emphasis on organic conversation flow, the interactive user experience guarantees seamless connection.


## **Technologies and Tools Used**

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** For tokenization, stemming, and intent classification.  
  - **Scikit-learn:** Used for training machine learning models (if applicable).  
  - **Flask (Optional):** For hosting the chatbot as a web application.  
- **Corpus Data:** Used for training and intent classification.

## **Project Structure**

```


## **How It Works**

1. **User Input:** The user provides input in natural language.
2. **Processing:** The chatbot uses NLP techniques to process the input, tokenize it, and classify the intent.
3. **Response Generation:** Based on the identified intent, a predefined or generated response is delivered to the user.

## **Setup and Installation**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Techsaksham/P4-Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

## **Potential Use Cases**

- **Customer Support:** Automating FAQs and customer interactions.
- **E-learning:** Providing quick answers to student queries.
- **Personal Assistance:** Assisting with reminders, queries, or scheduling.


## **Future Enhancements**

- Integrate **machine learning models** for dynamic intent classification.
- Use advanced **transformer models** like BERT or GPT for more sophisticated responses.
- Deploy the chatbot as a **web or mobile application** for enhanced accessibility.
